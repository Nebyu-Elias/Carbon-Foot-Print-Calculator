           <h4>As our organization expands, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to track and
manage our carbon emissions. The lack of a reliable and user-friendly tool to
measure and track our carbon footprint impedes EIA’s ability to implement
effective sustainability strategies and demonstrate our company’s
environmental responsibility to stakeholders. This is an ongoing and very
important project for Eco Impact Africa. Your goal as a C# developer is to
develop an app that can accurately calculate EIA’s carbon footprint. The
successful implementation of this project will be a deciding factor for your
consideration in the subsequent phase of the project, which will involve
more advanced features like database management, APIs, front-end
development, data visualization, and authentication and authorization.</h4>
